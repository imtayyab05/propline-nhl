"""Sportsbook lines — game totals, team totals, and pitcher strikeout props.

The client wants the model's grade shown next to the market's number, so he can see
where they disagree rather than reading a score in isolation.

CREDIT BUDGET — read before changing anything here
--------------------------------------------------
The Odds API's free tier is 500 credits a month, and the two market families cost
wildly different amounts:

  totals / team totals   one call covers the whole slate      ~1-2 credits
  pitcher strikeouts     a per-EVENT endpoint, so 15 games    ~15 credits

At one pull a day that is roughly 480 credits a month — inside the free tier, but
with almost no headroom. At three pulls a day it is ~1,350 and the key dies in the
second week, silently, mid-slate.

So odds are fetched ONCE per slate and cached to disk. Later runs of the same day
reuse the file. If the cache is present this module makes no requests at all, which
is what keeps five scheduled runs a day affordable.
