"""Groq — plain-English reasons for the top picks.

The LLM does NOT rank anything. Scores come from propline/scoring.py; Groq only turns
an already-decided shortlist into readable sentences. That keeps the betting logic
inspectable and means a bad model day can never reorder the board.

Cost control: one batched request per run covering every pick, rather than one call
per player. Comfortably inside Groq's free tier.

  starters", not "combined offense of 0.674".
- combined_bullpen_tired / opp_bullpen_tired: 0 = fully rested pen, 1 = most arms
  worked recently. Say "the pen is short-handed" or "the pen is rested".
- opp_starter_weak: how much the opposing starter gives up. Say "a starter who has
  been hittable", not the number.
